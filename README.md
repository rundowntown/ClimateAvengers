## Introduction
This project aims to explore the impact of micro-climate conditions on crop production. By correlating regional climate conditions with crop yields across the United States, we aim to demonstrate a proof-of-concept modeling approach that can recommend crop production adjustments based on dynamic weather patterns.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

***(Users do not need to run these scripts, as the cleaned and preprocessed datasets are already available in the repository.)***

The `Code/Prep` repository contains scripts used for data cleaning and preprocessing, which were crucial in preparing the datasets used in our analyses. These scripts are included for transparency and for those interested in understanding or replicating our preprocessing steps.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

### Available Data

The preprocessed datasets used for analysis are available in the `Data/` directory. These datasets have been cleaned, merged, and formatted for direct use in the analysis scripts provided in the `Code/Analysis` repository.

> Links to the raw datasets used for data preparation and preprocessing can be found in the `ExternalData.txt` file.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

### Scripts

Although it is **not necessary to run these scripts** to use the preprocessed data, here is a brief description of what each script does and their respective output file locations:
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Weather Data Preparation

- `normalsCountyConverter.py`
  -  **Description**: Converts raw 30-year normals data into a county-level summary, handling missing values and standardizing units.
     - ***Output***: `{myState}NormalsReady.csv`.

- `dailyRawCombiner.py`
  - **Description**: Combines GSOD NOAA data, which comes shipped in multiple
files, into a single .CSV for each State selected. User must set the State and Year Ranges of the files at the top of the script.
     - ***Output***: `{state}DailyRaw.csv`

- `dailyClimateBasicCleaner.py`
  - **Description**: Enhances the cleanliness and usability of daily climate data for a specified state. It focuses on normalizing data formats, decoding complex data fields into usable formats, and handling missing data with sophisticated data cleaning techniques.
     - ***Output***: `{myState}DailyCleaned.csv`

- `combinedDiagnosticImpute.py`
  - **Description**: Addresses missing data within a comprehensive weather dataset and includes advanced visualization to illustrate data patterns. It is designed to clean and impute missing values across various weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, and more.
    - ***Output***: `Imputed_Combined_Daily_Normals.csv`
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

#### Crop Raster Data Preprocessing

- `TIFtoCSV.py`
  - **Description**: Converts geospatial raster data *(.tif files)* representing annual crop data for California and Florida into a more accessible CSV format. This conversion facilitates easier analysis and integration with other data types in the project.
    - ***Output***: `{state}TopCropLonLat_{year}.csv`

- `cropCountyShaper.py `
  - **Description**: Converts and integrates agricultural data from `TIFtoCSV_R.py` with geospatial county information. It processes annual crop data by associating crop data points with the corresponding county boundaries through spatial joins, and then groups and aggregates this data for further analysis.
    - ***Output***: `{state}TopCropLonLat_{year}_with_County_Grouped.csv`

- `cropCountyAllYearsCombine.py`
  - **Description**: Consolidate agricultural data from multiple years into a single dataset. It processes files generated by `cropCountyShaper.py`, which are specific to crop types and geographic data for counties within a state, and creates a comprehensive dataset that spans multiple years.
    - ***Output***: `{state}CropsCountyReady.csv`

> *Optional Scripts used for debugging and proof-of-concepts:*
> - `cropYearlyCSVAnalysis.r`
>    - **Description**: Filters out unwanted crop types, aggregates crop frequency data, selects the top 10 crops by acreage, and visualizes the data through density maps to verify the validity of longitude and latitude data.
>       - ***Output***: `{state}_top_crops_lonlat_{year}.csv` , `{state}_top_crops_freq_{year}.csv`
> - `TIFtoCSV_R.r`
>    - **Description**: Same as the analogous python script that goes by the same name. Memory issues necessitated the transition to Python for large raster files, like California and Florida.
>       - ***Output***: `{state}TopCropLatLon_{year}`

## ArcGIS Crop Suitability Analysis


### Tools Used
- **ArcGIS**: For this project, we utilized the Weighted Overlay spatial analysis tool within ArcGIS to analyze and combine data layers effectively.
  - **Note**: ArcGIS, which includes ArcMap, ***is a licensed software suite that requires a paid subscription***. While we leveraged this tool to benefit from its robust capabilities in spatial analysis and unique modeling features, ***we do not intend for others to feel compelled to purchase this software***. We found it to be a valuable resource for gaining perspectives and insights into the data that we otherwise could not have achieved.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

### Methodology

The Suitability Analysis utilizes data from:
- `CaliforniaCropDataFromRasters.zip` datasets, found in the `ExternalData.txt` file.
    - **Description**: Ten years of crop production statistics across various counties. 
- `CaliforniaCardinalData.csv`, found in the `/Data/Crop_Data/` directory.
    - **Description**: The total days that crops can be cultivated in each county.

The aim is to evaluate and rank each county based on two primary criteria:
1. **Annual Crop Production**: The total number of crops produced annually in each county.
2. **Cultivation Days**: The total days crops can be cultivated in each county, derived from the Cardinal Crop dataset.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

### Data Ranking
Each county is assigned two ranks:
- **Crop Count Rank**: Based on the annual crop production.
- **Cultivation Days Rank**: Based on the total days that crops can be cultivated as per the Cardinal Crop dataset.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>

### Weighted Overlay Analysis
We employed the Weighted Overlay tool in ArcMap to integrate the rankings with respective weights for a comprehensive suitability analysis:
- **70% Weight on Crop Production**: Reflects the emphasis on the volume of crop output per county.
- **30% Weight on Cultivation Days**: Accounts for the climatic and temporal suitability for crop cultivation.

The analysis also incorporates additional factors such as proximity, land value, topology, and profitability, which are crucial for determining the overall agricultural viability of a county.

</div>
<br>

> *`GIS_CropSuitability_California.png` can be found in the `Visualizations/` directory*

This suitability analysis is designed to highlight counties with optimal conditions for crop production based on a combination of quantitative production data and cultivation feasibility. The resulting weighted analysis aids stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding agricultural investments and operations.
