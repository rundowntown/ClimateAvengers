## ArcGIS Crop Suitability Analysis


### Tools Used
- **ArcGIS**: For this project, we utilized the Weighted Overlay spatial analysis tool within ArcGIS to analyze and combine data layers effectively.
  - **Note**: ***ArcGIS is a licensed software suite that requires a paid subscription***. While we leveraged this tool to benefit from its robust capabilities in spatial analysis and unique modeling features, ***we do not intend for others to feel compelled to purchase this software***. We found it to be a valuable resource for gaining perspectives and insights into the data that we otherwise could not have achieved.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>


### Methodology

The Suitability Analysis utilizes data from:
- `CaliforniaCropDataFromRasters.zip` datasets, found in the `ExternalData.txt` file.
    - **Description**: Ten years of crop production statistics across various counties. 
- `CaliforniaCardinalData.csv`, found in the `Data/Crop_Data/` directory.
    - **Description**: The total days that crops can be cultivated in each county.

The aim is to evaluate and rank each county based on two primary criteria:
1. **Annual Crop Production**: The total number of crops produced annually in each county.
2. **Cultivation Days**: The total days crops can be cultivated in each county, derived from the Cardinal Crop dataset.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>


### Data Ranking
Each county is assigned two ranks:
- **Crop Count Rank**: Based on the annual crop production.
- **Cultivation Days Rank**: Based on the total days that crops can be cultivated as per the Cardinal Crop dataset.
<div align="right" style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div>


### Weighted Overlay Analysis
We employed the Weighted Overlay tool in ArcMap to integrate the rankings with respective weights for a comprehensive suitability analysis:
- **70% Weight on Crop Production**: Reflects the emphasis on the volume of crop output per county.
- **30% Weight on Cultivation Days**: Accounts for the climatic and temporal suitability for crop cultivation.

The analysis also incorporates additional factors such as proximity, land value, topology, and profitability, which are crucial for determining the overall agricultural viability of a county.

<div align="center">

</div>
<br>

> *`GIS_CropSuitability_California.png` can be found in the `Visualizations/` directory*

This suitability analysis is designed to highlight counties with optimal conditions for crop production based on a combination of quantitative production data and cultivation feasibility. The resulting weighted analysis aids stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding agricultural investments and operations.
